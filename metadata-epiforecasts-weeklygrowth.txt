team_model_designation: primary
methods: A Bayesian autoregressive model using weekly incidence data. Both cases and the growth rate are assumed to be AR(1) processes with the growth rate being both differenced and scaled by a linear decay parameter. An application of the forecast.vocs R package.

Both cases and the growth rate are assumed to be AR(1) processes with the growth rate being both differenced and scaled by a linear decay parameter. The model is implemented using the forecast.vocs R package (https://epiforecasts.io/forecast.vocs). The analysis code is available here: https://github.com/seabbs/ecdc-weekly-growth-forecasts
